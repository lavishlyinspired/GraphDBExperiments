The first two tumors were managed with stereotactic radiosurgery because the patient declined surgery; a third new small cell lung cancer later developed and was treated with chemoradiation.

{"type":"node","id":"46","labels":["Article"],"properties":{"datetime":"2024-02-29T00:00Z","title":"Case Report: Combined Small Cell Lung Carcinoma with Adenocarcinoma","body":"This case describes a 73-year-old male with combined small cell lung carcinoma (CSCLC) and adenocarcinoma discovered during a routine check-up. Imaging revealed a right lung mass with no symptoms, and surgical lobectomy was performed; pathology confirmed both components. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient remained well for at least two weeks after surgery. The report emphasizes early detection and surgical treatment for this rare tumor variant.","uri":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8854358/"}}

CT and PET scans showed distinct lesions with different histologies: keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, solid predominant adenocarcinoma, and small cell lung cancer. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was performed, and all tumors were resected. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was given, and the patient remained without recurrence at one year follow-up.

Chronic symptoms included weight loss and fatigue, with a long history of smoking and COPD.
